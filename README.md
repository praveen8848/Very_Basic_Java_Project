The project is named as "ATM Interface".
<br>
This Project I created is totally based on basic OOPs concept in Java, that is object and classes.
<br>
I have used object and classes to design or create simple ATM interface that accept user by their ATM pin,
once the pin is correct(here correct refers to only the fact that pin should be of four digits) user directed to 
menu where multiple options available like ATM and you can perform some dummy action over these options.
The actions user can perform are:-
<br>
1. Check Balance.
<br>
2.Withdraw Money.
<br>
3.Deposit Money.
